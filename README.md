# Go tests

[![Go Reference](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/github.com/pat42smith/gotest.svg)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/pat42smith/gotest)

This package provides some simple utilities for testing Go code.

Some test cases use standard Unix utilities such as /bin/sh or /bin/printf;
these may not work in Windows.
